# iPhone stock checker

Searches for iPhone SE (Space Grey, 64GB) stock availability at Liverpool ONE Apple Store.

## Installation

Install [`jq`](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/):

    brew install jq

Create a file containing the email address at which you’d like receive notifications:

    echo "mail@example.com" > email.txt

Replace `/Users/zarinozappia/repos/iphone-stock-check/` in `uk.co.zarino.iphonestockcheck.plist` with the path to your checkout of this repo.

Install the plist and tell launchd to use it:

    mkdir -p ~/Library/LaunchAgents/
    cp uk.co.zarino.iphonestockcheck.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents/
    launchctl load -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/uk.co.zarino.iphonestockcheck.plist

Check it’s installed:

    launchctl list | grep zarino

The script will run once immediately upon being loaded into launchctl, and then every 600 seconds thereafter.

So you should get an email to the address you specified. If you don’t, any output generated by the script will be logged to `stdout.log` and `stderr.log` in the repo directory.

## Uninstallation

    launchctl unload -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/uk.co.zarino.iphonestockcheck.plist
    rm ~/Library/LaunchAgents/uk.co.zarino.iphonestockcheck.plist
